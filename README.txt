Imports your running activities from the Runtastic website. Displays the data via shortcodes on your webpage. Widget included.

== Description ==
Do you ever want to display your running activities from Runtastic.com on your own Website? This is no problem any longer.

RunPress gives you the opportunity to query the Runtastic website by using your Runtastic username and password. It imports your Runtastic running activities (and at the moment ONLY the running activities) into a table of your wordpress installation. 

You will be capable of viewing your runtastic running activities in the admin backend. By the use of shortcodes you're able to show your activities on non-admin pages of your site like posts and pages. Use the shortcode generator to easily create the needed shortcodes without any programming knowledge.

A widget is included to show your very latest running activity, your high-scores or the last 5 running activities in a table.

RunPress is continuously under development. Just share your wishes with me and I'll have a look at them.

You want to see it in action? Have a look at the plugin homepage <a href="http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2247" target="_blank">here</a>.

= I've installed and configured the plugin but I do not see any running activities on my webpage! =
You've got to import your running activities from Runtastic into your wordpress database and setup a shortcode to display your data in your webpage. Have a look at the admin page, "RunPress", "Local DB" or check the documentation.
